##the beach
You are the beach (or rather the sea water and waves crashing up on the beach shore). Use the crank to generate waves that affects items on the beach. Sometimes items are floating in the water and your waves throw it up on the beach.

##sand crab
You are a crab walking along the beach. Move crab with controls, and use the crank to generate waves to splash enemies?
